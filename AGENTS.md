# Working in this repository

Read `docs/adr/` before changing repository layout, build wiring, or test setup.
Read `docs/testing.mdx` before writing or changing tests.

`docs/` is a Blume site. Run `pnpm docs:dev` to browse it locally and
`pnpm docs:build` after changing pages or documentation configuration.

Infrastructure belongs in `infra/`; Worker bindings are defined once in
`infra/src/worker-bindings.ts` and imported by each runtime.

Workspaces export TypeScript source, so Turbo tasks depend on the `transit`
task to hash their dependencies' source. A workspace that imports another
workspace by relative path, as `@repo/infra` imports `workers/*`, lists those
paths in its own `transit` inputs in `turbo.json`. Without them, a cached
result survives a change it should not.

Run `pnpm check`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm test` before committing.

`.repos/` contains read-only source references. When writing Effect code, read
`.repos/effect/LLMS.md` and inspect the matching version there before choosing
an API or project idiom.

# This is NOT the Turborepo you know

Turborepo configuration, task behavior, and CLI commands can vary between installed versions and may differ from your training data. Resolve the `turbo` package from this file's directory or relevant workspace; in monorepos, it may not be visible from the repository root. For example, run `node -p "require.resolve('turbo/package.json')"` from a workspace that depends on `turbo`.

Read `docs/README.md` inside that installed package first, then read the relevant pages from its `docs/` directory before changing Turborepo configuration or commands. Heed deprecation notices. These bundled docs match the installed package version and are available without network access.

This block is written and re-added by `turbo` before repository-scoped commands when an AI agent is detected. In the Turborepo source repository, its template is defined in `crates/turborepo-cli/src/cli/agent_guidance.rs`. Removing the managed block while updates are enabled means a later qualifying invocation will add it again. Set `"agentGuidance": false` in the root `turbo.json` or `turbo.jsonc` to opt out; this does not remove an existing block. Keep the block committed with your work to avoid an uncommitted change on the next agent invocation.
