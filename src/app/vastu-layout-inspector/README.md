# Vastu Layout Inspector

A modern web application for analyzing home layouts according to Vastu Shastra principles. Upload layout images and use an interactive compass overlay to understand directional orientations and spatial arrangements in your home or property.

## ✨ Features

- **Image Upload & Storage**: Upload home layout images with automatic local storage persistence
- **Interactive Compass Overlay**: Draggable compass that overlays directional lines on your layout
- **Compass Rotation**: Adjustable compass orientation with rotation handle for precise alignment
- **8-Direction Analysis**: Complete compass with North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, and Northwest directions
- **Color-Coded Directions**: Each direction has a unique color for easy identification
- **Precise Alignment**: Directional lines extend to container edges for accurate spatial analysis
- **Clipboard Image Support**: Paste images directly from clipboard for quick analysis
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices with mobile-optimized controls
- **Local Persistence**: Images and layout configurations are automatically saved locally and restored on page refresh

## 🧭 How It Works

### Compass Directions & Colors

Each cardinal and intercardinal direction is represented by a unique color:

- **North (N)** - Red (`#dc2626`)
- **Northeast (NE)** - Orange (`#ea580c`)
- **East (E)** - Amber (`#d97706`)
- **Southeast (SE)** - Lime (`#65a30d`)
- **South (S)** - Emerald (`#059669`)
- **Southwest (SW)** - Cyan (`#0891b2`)
- **West (W)** - Violet (`#7c3aed`)
- **Northwest (NW)** - Fuchsia (`#c026d3`)

### Vastu Analysis

The compass overlay helps you analyze:

- **Room Placement**: Understand which rooms are positioned in which directions
- **Element Orientation**: Check the directional alignment of key elements like entrances, kitchen, bedrooms
- **Spatial Relationships**: Visualize how different areas of your home relate to cardinal directions
- **Vastu Compliance**: Assess your layout against traditional Vastu Shastra guidelines

2. **Clipboard Paste**: Press Ctrl+V (Cmd+V on Mac) to paste an image from clipboard
3. **Supported Formats**: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
4. Your image will be automatically saved locally for future sessions

### Step 2: Position the Compass

1. Once your image loads, you'll see a transparent compass center
2. Click and drag the compass to position it anywhere on your layout
3. The compass represents the center point for directional analysis

### Step 3: Adjust Compass Orientation

1. Use the rotation handle to adjust the compass orientation
2. Align the compass with your layout's actual directional orientation
3. Fine-tune the rotation for precise directional analysis

### Step 4: Analyze Directions

1. Colored lines extend from the compass center to the edges
2. Each line represents a cardinal or intercardinal direction
3. Use these lines to identify which rooms/areas fall in which directions
4. Compare with Vastu Shastra guidelines for optimal placement

### Step 5: Reset and Adjust

- Use the "Reset Compass" button to return the compass to the center
- Use the "Remove Image" button to clear the current image and upload a new one
- Your image and compass configuration persist automatically and will be restored on page refresh

## 🔮 Vastu Shastra Context

Vastu Shastra is an ancient Indian architectural science that emphasizes the importance of directional orientation in building design. Key principles include:

- **Entrance Placement**: Ideally in North, Northeast, or East
- **Kitchen Location**: Southeast or Northwest directions
- **Master Bedroom**: Southwest for stability and prosperity
- **Prayer Room**: Northeast for spiritual energy
- **Staircase Position**: Southwest, South, or West directions

This tool helps visualize these directional relationships in your layout.
